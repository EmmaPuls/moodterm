- #### Context
  - I've completed the ownership and structs sections of [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html)
  - I've been reviewing the [cacao examples](https://github.com/ryanmcgrath/cacao) to understand how it works better
    - I've spent a bit of time understanding why NSTextView is not yet supported
    - I've decided to continue using cacao for now for the UI
  - I've been reading about concurrency
  
  #### What is in this change
  - I've refactored the UI a bit to seperate the concerns and done a bit of a visual refresh
